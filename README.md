The name of the game is Simon Says. 
The rules of the game are simple: follow the pattern that Simon Says. If Simon says to click blue, you click blue. If Simon says to click green, you click green.

BUT! There is a catch...you must remember the pattern that is given in order to move on to the next level, and click that pattern before adding the new color to the end.

Example:
Simon says blue. You click blue.
Then Simon says green. You must first click blue, then click green.
If he then says yellow, you click blue, green, then yellow. 

You follow this pattern until you forget the pattern and click the wrong color. Then the game starts back at level 1.

Sound fun? Go ahead..give it a go.

What I used to create this game:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Jquery
..and a lot of help from stack overflow.

**This game was made as part of a coding course. While I did check my answers at the end, all code is my own**
